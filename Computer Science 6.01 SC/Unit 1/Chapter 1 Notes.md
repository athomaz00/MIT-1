# Course Goals

- Learn to use modularity and abstraction to design solutions to problems encountered in both software and electirical engineering.
- See how mathematical models can help in the design and analysis of systems and gain experience in deciding what is important to model.
- Engage me in both thought and arguments on the design of systems.
- Teach the important basics of electrical engineering and computer science.

# Managing Complexity

*Modularity* is the idea of building a component that can be re-used. *Abstraction* is the idea that after the implementation of a module has been finished most of the details of its construction are no longer important. These two concepts allow for complexity to be managed in such a way that a human can build systems with more complexity than they can deal with at a moment. This technique can be used in the design of many types of systems including computer and electrical systems.

Different models can be used in order to get different insight into a given system. For example one might model opening a door in terms of physics, but at other times analysis might be more interested in different facts about a door like how many people pass through it.

The theme of this course will be learning to select and build models out of modules that are constructed to both modular and abstracted.

# An Example Problem

The chapter introduces an example problem in which you are given a motor attached to whweels and a photo-resistor. It asks the question of how these two things should be linked.

Then it introduces the Primitive-Combination-Abstraction-Pattern (PACP). This basically says that you should work with a basic set of primitives, combinations, and abstractions in order to limit the design space.

It then jumps down into the circuit level which I don't have enough of an EE background to understand. After that it proceeds to move up the design chain to the computer and then to the programming language and then to how the problem is modeled in the programming language.
