# Managing Complexity At Higher Levels

- Imperative
	- Think in terms of one operation following another operation following another
- Functional
	- Think in terms of functions that don't have side-effects.
	- Treating functions as first-class citizens.
	- Very modular and easier to debug.
	- Expressive.
- Object Oriented
	- Data and Functions bound together in objects

What if we moved to a higher level. How would we manage the complexity of processes? A state machine can do this. He gave the example of building a robot by dividing it into a map maker, a planner, and a mover. They each took the input of the one that proceeded them. That is the power of the state machine.
