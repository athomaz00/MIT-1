The goal is to learn how to make and gain insight into the design and construction of really complicated systems.

We'll be going over:

- Abstractions and Moudlarity in Computer Science
- Designing and analyzing using signals.
- Designing circuits.
- Building systems that plan out tasks using probability.

A system is compositional when you can take a copmplex expression and replace it with a simple expression.

Composition is a powerful way to build complex systems.

PCAP is a framework to manage complexity.

- primitives: +, *, ===, numbers, booleans, strings
- combinations: if, while, square, lists, dictionaries, ojbects
- abstractions: def, classes
- patterns: higher order functions, super-classes, sub-classes
