# Define a procedure, called evenSquares that takes a list of numbers as input and returns
# a list of the squares of the input values that are even. Use a list comprehension. You
# can test whether a number is even by seeing if the number mod 2 is 0, that is,
# x % 2 == 0

def evenSquare(arr):
	return [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]

# Use a list comprehension to define a procedure, called sumAbsProd , that returns the sum
# of the absolute values of the products of all the pairs of numbers where one is drawn
# from each of the two input lists.
# >>> sumAbsProd([2,-3],[4,-5])
# 45
# That is 2*4 + 2*5 + 3*4 + 3*5 = 45.
# Use the sum and abs built-in functions in Python.

def sumAbsProd(x_arr, y_arr):
	return sum([abs(x * y) for x in x_arr for y in y_arr])
