      "When you take a sample from a population and compute the mean you get a **point estimate** for the population mean. However, if you were to do the same thing again, but with a different sample, you would probably get a different point estimate. A point estimate gives you an estimation that is usually wrong.\n",

      "**Confidence intervals** are a solution to this problem. Confidence intervals don't give you one point. They give a range of values that the statistic being estimated is likely to be between. I say likely, because they also come with estimations of confidence. Confidence intervals let you say, \"The parameter lies between seven and ten with 90% confidence.\" The 90% confidence portion of that statement would usually be called a **level of confidence**. Confidence intervals can be thought of as a point estimate plus or minus a **margin of error**."

      "On average only 95% of the confidence intervals above will contain the population mean. That is because the statistics test is only done at $\\alpha=0.05$. Sometimes all of them will contain it. Sometimes only a few. It all depends on the sample mean, $\\bar{x}$. If you were really clever you might have noticed that I snuck in a 1.96 into the above code twice. That was a standard deviation. More aptly, it was the standard deviations between 95% of the data lay. In other words we can use a probability density function in combination with standard deviations in order to compute a confidence interval with any $\\alpha$. Below I put code that includes this lookup step."
