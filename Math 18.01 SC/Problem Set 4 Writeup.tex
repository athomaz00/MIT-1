\section {Continuos But Not Smooth}

Find values for $a$ and $b$ given the piecewise function,
$$
f(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
ax+b, \quad x > 0\\
sin2x, \quad x \leq 0
\end {array}
\right.$$

such that the function is continuos but not differentiable.\\

Given $0=a0+b$ we can conclude it is continuous whenver $b=0$ . However the slope of $ax+b$ is always $a$ so as long as a doesn't match it will be fine. At the very least $a \leq 0$ will be safe.
