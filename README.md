# My Modern Education

## What This Is

This is my attempt at documenting the work I did while making use of MIT OpenCourseWare and other materials that I have found online. It contains problem sets, exams, and notes which you can browse through if you feel the need to review my work. My hope is that despite the lack of credentials this repository will prove to you that I have some level of mastery over the materials.

## My Motivation

While going to community college I discovered that some of my teachers weren't as good as I would have liked. I wanted world class instruction, but I was at the wrong institution. Meanwhile, the world class instructors had begun putting their lesson plans and lectures online for anyone to use. I had two options: I could either transfer to a great college and get the instruction I was looking for at great cost or I could get the education I was seeking for free online. On one hand the free education was better. On the other hand the debt would buy me credentials. In the end the competent instruction of MIT, Standford, and Caltech won out. I chose an internet based education.
